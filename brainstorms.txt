slack app for gathering feedback
================================

- Weekly engineering guild sync with several presentations given on a variety of topics (conference recaps, new technologies, post mortems, etc)
- Want to capture NPS and freeform feedback for presenters and their managers
	- Doubles as a method to capture meaningful feedback and steer the direction of future content
- Current process was to manully create the google form(s) from a template, assign the presenter(s)/mangers as collaborators, and post the form to our engineering slack channel
	- Annoying!
- Idea: build a slack app to automatically create the google forms from a slack command
- Use gscripts to interface with the google form apis and host the "application"


/dev/shm issue with headless chrome on heroku
=============================================

- TL;DR use the `--disable-dev-shm-usage` flag when running headless chrome on heroku private spaces

- Using headless chrome to generate PDFs on a heroku worker dyno
- Heroku enterprise account with production dynos using private spaces (different from the common runtime)
	- https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/private-spaces
- Running into a memory issue when generating larger PDFs, but only in production (TODO embed error message)
- Headless chrome uses /dev/shm for shared memory
	- "/dev/shm is nothing but implementation of traditional shared memory concept. It is an efficient means of passing data between programs. One program will create a memory portion, which other processes (if permitted) can access."
	- https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/what-is-devshm-and-its-practical-usage.html
- Private space runtime is configured different, most importantly it doesn't mount /dev/shm (TODO embed screenshot of `df -h`)
- Use the `--disable-dev-shm-usage` flag to force headless chrome to use /tmp instead of /dev/shm
